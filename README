ncsutils (nesca network utils): recently, along with the library comes a set of network utilities;
check folder utils/.

  uitls/ping.c         connection test.
  uitls/xdump.c        simply hex dump tool.
  utils/instat.c       traffic monitoring.
  utils/hexflood.c     very fast ddos with any specified packages.

                                           LIBNCSNET

libncsnet (nesca network library): a free set of [low-level and no] networking tools;
works on linux and (unlikely, but) bsd systems. Library provides the most flexible, fastest, and
largest set of tools for its tasks.

protocols:  IP, IP6, TCP, UDP, ICMP4, ICMP6, IGMP, SCTP, ARP, ETHERNET2,
            HTTP, FTP, SMTP, SOCKS5(not), UDP-LITE;

crypt:      MD5, SHA-512, SHA-256, ADLER32, BASE64, CRC-8,
            CRC-16, CRC-32, CRC-64, SHA-1, MD4;

addr:       IP4, IP6, MAC, CIDR, RANGE, URL;

random:     CMWC, MT19937, MSM;

syntax:     HTML;

The library's work with transport, network, and data link prototocols can be
quite complex. But there are always examples in [tests/], and [RFCs].

Documentation of some functions and clauses can be found in [docs/], to view
it you need to call [man ./<file.3>] on the required documentation file, for
example, [man ./url.h]; OR, see [https://oldteamhost.github.io/database/main.html]

To compile, run the following commands in the library's source directory,

  ./configure
  make (on bsd use "gmake")

The first one is needed to customize the source code and Makefile. The
second one is for source code compilation.
